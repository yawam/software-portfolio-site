            ðŸš€ Hi! I&apos;m Papa Yaw!,
            <br /> A passionate Software Engineering student at BYU-Idaho,
            focusing on Full-Stack Web Development and various web and software
            development technologies. I&apos;ve always had the resolve of not
            always being the user but the developer too. <br />
            Now that I know how things work, It&apos;s been blast and I&apos;m
            excited for the future. At this point I&apos;m confident that with
            the right team, I can build almost anything. ðŸ’ª <br /> It&apos;s fun
            to see the results of building useful interactive full-stack
            applications. What are you working on next? I think I might want to
            be a part of it. ðŸŒŸ
